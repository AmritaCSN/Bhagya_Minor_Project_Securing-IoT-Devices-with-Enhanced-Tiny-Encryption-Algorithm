# Bhagya_Minor_Project_Securing-IoT-Devices-with-Enhanced-Tiny-Encryption-Algorithm
This repository contains the implementation codes for the project "Securing IoT Devices with Enhanced Tiny Encryption Algorithm", focusing on lightweight cryptography for resource-constrained IoT environments.
## Overview of the Project
The exponential growth of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has brought about significant security challenges, particularly due to their limited computational resources and deployment in critical applications such as smart cities, healthcare and industrial automation.  The Tiny Encryption Algorithm (TEA) has gained wide adoption for its simplicity and minimal resource requirements, making it a suitable choice for constrained IoT environments. However, TEAâ€™s fixed key scheduling mechanism leaves it vulnerable to cryptanalytic attacks, especially known-plaintext attacks. To address these vulnerabilities, this project introduces an enhanced version of TEA that incorporates a dynamic round key scheduling mechanism, improving its resilience against evolving security threats while preserving its lightweight characteristics. In terms of overall security and performance, the enhanced TEA algorithm outperformed the original TEA. By offering a secure and efficient encryption solution tailored to the specific limitations and security demands of IoT ecosystems, this project contributes significantly to the field of IoT cryptography.
